Release Notes: _See `index.php` source comment_

Live Demo: [purple-index](https://zemiancodeplayground.000webhostapp.com/purple-index/index.php)

To try it, run this:

	php -S localhost:3000
	open http://localhost:3000

Why called `purple-index`? I want an adjective starts with `P` that stands for `PHP`, so Purple Index is
just as good as any.
